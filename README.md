# MiTV

This project is a complete "drive" like system for photos and videos.  
It has been intended for Dockerization on an OpenMediaVault NAS, and the public shared folders are the one available through this system.  
The frontend consists of a website to access the drive's content in a user friendly way.  
The backend has a storage API but it also generates useful media metadata.
