# Backend

## Overview

The backend is served using flask and a mongodb (nosql) database.
The database stores metadata for images and folders (see db_interface).

Metadata are created with meta_data_creation (see file for options)
You must install the image_metadata package before using it as a command line utility (install with pip).
